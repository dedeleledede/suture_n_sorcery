# Suture & Sorcery
[English](README.md) | [Português (BR)](README.pt-BR.md)

A **dark magic** mod for Minecraft (currently) **Fabric 1.21.10** that explores blood, thread, and ritual mechanics. Focused on ritual craft, viscera-laced alchemy, and the quiet horror of “useful” power.

This project leans into the kind of magic that feels **earned** and measured in stains, stitches, consequences. Rather than fireworks and convenience. If you like occult systems, grim craftsmanship, and UI that feels like it belongs in a forbidden workshop, you’re in the right place.

> **Status:** In active development. Expect changes, refactors, and the occasional broken ritual circle.

## Design Pillars
- **Blood is a material**, not a color. It has weight, cost, and purpose.
- **Ritual-first progression**: power comes from preparation.
- **Industrial occult**: tools that look functional… until you notice what they’re made for.
- **Atmosphere**: subtle audio/visual cues, moody interfaces.
- **Risk & restraint**: shortcuts exist, but they tend to cut *you* too.

## Requirements
- Minecraft **1.21.10**
- Fabric Loader (latest for 1.21.10)
